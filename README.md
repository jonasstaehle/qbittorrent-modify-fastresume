## Python script to change QBittorents fastresume files  

Bencode module can be installed with "pip install bencode.py" found here: https://pypi.org/project/bencode.py/  
**BACK UP YOUR FILES BEFORE PROCEEDING!!! THIS WILL OVERWRITE THEM!!!  
CORRUPTION MAY HAPPEN!!! USE AT YOUR OWN RISK!!!**  
I would recommend COPYING the "BT_backup" directory to your desktop and running this script on the backup to ensure the originals are untouched.  

save_path and qBt-savepath are set to the same value- qBt-savepath will be overwritten
